# Measurement Plot

## measurement_plot_widget.py
A widget to show an image as heatmap with the only the horizontal profile show the values of the corresponding row in 
the image.
Basically reduced [LaserProfiler](../LaserProfiler/README.md), but with extra API to allow assignment of (x,y) -> value.
